# Due to NDA cannot tell exact question and also I couldn't find it online anywhere. But the question was kinda similar to this https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix

# : Cleared phone screen
# : My thoughts on interview - Be quick in terms of thought process and coding. Don't waste too much time explaining brute force approach. max 5 min for brute force. If the interviewer thinks that you're going in the right direction towards optimal solution, he'll NOT ask you to implement brute force instead he'll ask you to code optimal approach.
