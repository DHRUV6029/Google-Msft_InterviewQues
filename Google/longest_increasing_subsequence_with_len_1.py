# Given a integer array 'a' with 'n' elements, find the length of the longest subsequence where a[j]-a[i]=1 given j>i . The order should remain the same.

# In other words, it's longest increasing subsequence were diff between two consecutive element is 1

# Testcase 1:
# a = [2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6]
# output: 5
# Explanation: the logest subsequence will be [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Update: I solved it using recursion and then optimized to DP, but still got a below average feedback stating "was able to come up with the brute force approach but cldn't optimized it furtherðŸ˜¢".
# Is there any better optimized solutions for this problem or was I simply out of luck!!
