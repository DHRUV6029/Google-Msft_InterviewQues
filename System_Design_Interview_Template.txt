1. Clarify Requirements

Ask questions to clarify the problem.

What is the primary purpose of the system?
What are the functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., scalability, latency, throughput)?
Are there any constraints or assumptions?
Define the scope of the discussion.
E.g., Are you designing the full system or just a specific part?

2. Establish the High-Level Design

Sketch out a high-level architecture.

Identify core components (e.g., clients, servers, databases, APIs, message queues).

Define how components interact.

Describe the data flow between components.

3. Deep Dive into Components

Focus on key components and explain how they work.

Data storage: SQL vs. NoSQL, replication, sharding.

APIs: REST vs. GraphQL, versioning.

Scaling: Load balancers, caching strategies.

Communication: Synchronous vs. asynchronous, protocols (e.g., HTTP, gRPC).

Mention specific technologies youâ€™d consider (e.g., Kafka, Redis, AWS S3).

4. Address Non-Functional Requirements

Scalability: How will the system handle increased traffic?

Reliability: How will you ensure fault tolerance and availability?

Security: How will you handle authentication, authorization, and encryption?

Performance: Caching, database indexing, minimizing latency.

5. Consider Trade-offs

Discuss trade-offs in your design choices.
E.g., Latency vs. consistency, complexity vs. simplicity.

Explain why you chose one approach over another.

6. Prepare for Scale

How would the system evolve to handle 10x, 100x traffic?

Address bottlenecks and plan for horizontal/vertical scaling.

7. Summarize Your Design

Recap the architecture, key components, and why your design meets the requirements.

Invite feedback or questions.
